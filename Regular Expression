in python 18/4 returns 4.5
and 18//4 is 4 which is round down
2**4 is same as 2^4
strings "Bucky Roberta" or 'Bucky Roberta'
for example when we have sentence with single quote like this:
I don't think she is 18 
you should use double quotes 
"I don't thinkn she is 18"
escaping characters
'I don\'t think she is 18'
print("Hey now brown cow")
print('c:\khatri\desktop\new folder')
it prints 
c:\khatri\desktop
\new folder
because of \n
we can use verbatum symbol which is r
print(r'c:\khatri\desktop\new folder')
you can add strings
firstName = "Bucky "
firstName+ McLovin 
results in Bucky McLovin
you can also do 
firstName*5 //printing multiple times
= Bucky Bucky Bucky Bucky Bucky

user = "Tuna McFish"
user[0] returns T
user[1] returns u
user[2] returns n
printing strings in reverse order
user[-1] returns h
user[-2] returns s
slicing out sections of strings
user[2:7] returns 'na Mc'
user[:7] means start with the begning and end at seven which returns 'Tuna Mc'
user[2:] means start with 2 and end at the end which returns 'na Mcfish'
determining string length
len('char') returns the number of characters in the word char which is 4
we can also pass variables to len function 
len(user) returns 11

------------------Lists
creating a list
players = [29, 58, 66, 71, 87]
players[2] returns 66
substituting values in list
players[2] = 68
now if you do 
players[2] it returns 68
you can also add members to list
players + [90,91,98] now when you press enter it returns
[29, 58, 66, 71, 87,90,91,98]
however it doesn't change the original list players, when you type 
players it returns [29,58,68,71,87]
if we want to change list permanently or if we want to append the players list we can do
players.append(120)
and now 
players return [29,58,68,71,87,120]
+ doesn't changes the original list where as append changes it permanently
slicing lists
players[:2] returns [29, 58]
you can also change the values like this
players[:2] = [0,0]
now players return [0,0,68,71,87,120]
we can also set the values to blank or delete them
playes[:2]= []
players now returns [68,71,87,120]
deleting the entire list can be achieved by
players[:] = []
now players returns [] //blank
